<p> Hi folks, welcome to my personal website. </p>
<p>
  I'm Gianluca and I was born on the 11th of February 1997 in Barletta(South Italy).
  Computer science, technologies, travelling, beer and food are my passions. 
  I've two dogs, and I love them.
</p>
<p>
  I started studying IT since I was 15. Right now, I'm a computer science student at
  Univeristy of Bari.
  After degree I'd like to work abroad, because I'm an adventurer, and adventurers need 
  a bit of fresh air sometimes.
</p>
<p> About my projects, you can find some on my github(link above). Enjoy! </p>
