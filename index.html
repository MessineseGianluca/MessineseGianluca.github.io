<p> Hi folks, welcome to my personal website. </p>
<p>
  I'm Gianluca and I was born on the 11th of February 1997 in Barletta(South Italy).
</p>



<p>
  I started studying IT since I was 15. Right now, I'm a computer science student at
  Univeristy of Bari.
  In March 2019 I'll be a Software Engineer Intern at HubSpot(Dublin). 
  I look forward to starting this new experience.


</p>

<p> Computer science, technologies, travelling, videogames, beer and food are my greatest passions. </p>

<p>
  If you have any question or want to know more about myself, don't hesitate to contact me.
</p>
<p> About my projects, you can find some on my github(link above). Cheers! </p>
